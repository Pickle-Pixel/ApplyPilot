## [Unreleased]

### Added
 **Greenhouse ATS support** - New discovery source for 129 AI/ML startups and tech companies using Greenhouse (Scale AI, Stripe, Figma, Notion, etc.). Uses official Greenhouse Job Board API (`boards-api.greenhouse.io`) for reliable, structured data.
 **New module**: `src/applypilot/discovery/greenhouse.py` - API-based fetcher with full job descriptions, parallel execution, location filtering, and query matching
 **New config**: `src/applypilot/config/greenhouse.yaml` - 129 verified Greenhouse employers organized by category (Core AI, Infrastructure, Fintech, Healthcare, etc.)
 **User config override** - Users can extend/modify employers via `~/.applypilot/greenhouse.yaml`
 **New CLI commands** - `applypilot greenhouse verify|discover|validate|list-employers|add-job` for managing Greenhouse employers
 **Pipeline integration** - Greenhouse fetcher runs automatically during `discover` stage alongside JobSpy, Workday, and SmartExtract

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added
- **Parallel workers for discovery/enrichment** - `applypilot run --workers N` enables
  ThreadPoolExecutor-based parallelism for Workday scraping, smart extract, and detail
  enrichment. Default is sequential (1); power users can scale up.
- **Apply utility modes** - `--gen` (generate prompt for manual debugging), `--mark-applied`,
  `--mark-failed`, `--reset-failed` flags on `applypilot apply`
- **Dry-run mode** - `applypilot apply --dry-run` fills forms without clicking Submit
- **5 new tracking columns** - `agent_id`, `last_attempted_at`, `apply_duration_ms`,
  `apply_task_id`, `verification_confidence` for better apply-stage observability
- **Manual ATS detection** - `manual_ats` list in `config/sites.yaml` skips sites with
  unsolvable CAPTCHAs (e.g. TCS iBegin)
- **Qwen3 `/no_think` optimization** - automatically saves tokens when using Qwen models
- **`config.DEFAULTS`** - centralized dict for magic numbers (`min_score`, `max_apply_attempts`,
  `poll_interval`, `apply_timeout`, `viewport`)

### Fixed
- **Config YAML not found after install** - moved `config/` into the package at
  `src/applypilot/config/` so YAML files (employers, sites, searches) ship with `pip install`
- **Search config format mismatch** - wizard wrote `searches:` key but discovery code
  expected `queries:` with tier support. Aligned wizard output and example config
- **JobSpy install isolation** - removed python-jobspy from package dependencies due to
  broken numpy==1.26.3 exact pin in jobspy metadata. Installed separately with `--no-deps`
- **Scoring batch limit** - default limit of 50 silently left jobs unscored across runs.
  Changed to no limit (scores all pending jobs in one pass)
- **Missing logging output** - added `logging.basicConfig(INFO)` so per-job progress for
  scoring, tailoring, and cover letters is visible during pipeline runs

### Changed
- **Blocked sites externalized** - moved from hardcoded sets in launcher.py to
  `config/sites.yaml` under `blocked:` key
- **Site base URLs externalized** - moved from hardcoded dict in detail.py to
  `config/sites.yaml` under `base_urls:` key
- **SSO domains externalized** - moved from hardcoded list in prompt.py to
  `config/sites.yaml` under `blocked_sso:` key
- **Prompt improvements** - screening context uses `target_role` from profile,
  salary section includes `currency_conversion_note` and dynamic hourly rate examples
- **`acquire_job()` fixed** - writes `agent_id` and `last_attempted_at` to proper columns
  instead of misusing `apply_error`
- **`profile.example.json`** - added `currency_conversion_note` and `target_role` fields
