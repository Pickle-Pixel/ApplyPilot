The LLM returns structured JSON, code assembles the final text. Header (name, contact)

Take the base resume and job description. Return a tailored resume as a JSON object.

## RECRUITER SCAN (6 seconds):
1. Title -- matches what they're hiring?
2. Summary -- 2 sentences proving you've done this work
3. First 3 bullets of most recent role -- verbs and outcomes match?
4. Skills -- must-haves visible immediately?

## SKILLS BOUNDARY (real skills only):
{skills_block}

You MAY add 2-3 closely related tools (Kubernetes if Docker, Terraform if AWS, Redis if PostgreSQL). No unrelated languages/frameworks.

## TAILORING RULES:

TITLE: Match the target role. Keep seniority (Senior/Lead/Staff). Drop company suffixes and team names.

SUMMARY: Rewrite from scratch. Lead with the 1-2 skills that matter most for THIS role. Sound like someone who's done this job.

SKILLS: Reorder each category so the job's must-haves appear first.

Reframe EVERY bullet for this role. Same real work, different angle. Every bullet must be reworded. Never copy verbatim.

PROJECTS: Reorder by relevance. Drop irrelevant projects entirely.

BULLETS: Strong verb + what you built + quantified impact. Vary verbs (Built, Designed, Implemented, Reduced, Automated, Deployed, Operated, Optimized). Most relevant first. Max 4 per section.

## VOICE:
- Write like a real engineer. Short, direct.
- GOOD: "Automated financial reporting with Python + API integrations, cut processing time from 10 hours to 2"
- BAD: "Leveraged cutting-edge AI technologies to drive transformative operational efficiencies"
- BANNED WORDS (using ANY of these = validation failure — do not use them even once):
  {banned_str}
- No em dashes. Use commas, periods, or hyphens.

## HARD RULES:
- Do NOT invent work, companies, degrees, or certifications
- Do NOT change real numbers ({metrics_str})
- Preserved companies: {companies_str} -- names stay as-is
- Preserved school: {school}
- Must fit 1 page.

## OUTPUT: Return ONLY valid JSON. No markdown fences. No commentary. No "here is" preamble.

VERDICT: PASS or FAIL
ISSUES: (list any problems, or "none")

## CONTEXT -- what the tailoring engine was instructed to do (all of this is ALLOWED):
- Change the title to match the target role
- Rewrite the summary from scratch for the target job
- Reorder bullets and projects to put the most relevant first
- Reframe bullets to use the job's language
- Drop low-relevance bullets and replace with more relevant ones from other sections
- Reorder the skills section to put job-relevant skills first
- Change tone and wording extensively

## WHAT IS FABRICATION (FAIL for these):
1. Adding tools, languages, or frameworks to TECHNICAL SKILLS that aren't in the original. The allowed skills are ONLY: {skills_str}
2. Inventing NEW metrics or numbers not in the original. The real metrics are: {metrics_str}
3. Inventing work that has no basis in any original bullet (completely new achievements).
4. Adding companies, roles, or degrees that don't exist.
5. Changing real numbers (inflating 80% to 95%, 500 nodes to 1000 nodes).

## WHAT IS NOT FABRICATION (do NOT fail for these):
- Rewording any bullet, even heavily, as long as the underlying work is real
- Combining two original bullets into one
- Splitting one original bullet into two
- Describing the same work with different emphasis
- Dropping bullets entirely
- Reordering anything
- Changing the title or summary completely

## TOLERANCE RULE:
The goal is to get interviews, not to be a perfect fact-checker. Allow up to 3 minor stretches per resume:
- Adding a closely related tool the candidate could realistically know is a MINOR STRETCH, not fabrication.
- Reframing a metric with slightly different wording is a MINOR STRETCH.
- Adding any LEARNABLE skill given their existing stack is a MINOR STRETCH.
- Only FAIL if there are MAJOR lies: completely invented projects, fake companies, fake degrees, wildly inflated numbers, or skills from a completely different domain.

Be strict about major lies. Be lenient about minor stretches and learnable skills. Do not fail for style, tone, or restructuring."""
