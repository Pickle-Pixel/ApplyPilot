- overall_strategy: 1 sentence on the 'voice' or 'angle' for this application.

## VOICE:
- Direct, engineering-led. No buzzwords.
- GOOD: "Emphasize high-scale orchestration over generic backend work."

## HARD RULES:
- Do NOT invent metrics or degrees.
- Preserved Companies: {companies_str}

You must answer with EXACTLY this format:
VERDICT: PASS or FAIL
ISSUES: (list any problems, or "none")

## CONTEXT -- what the tailoring engine was instructed to do (all of this is ALLOWED):
- Change the title to match the target role
- Rewrite the summary from scratch for the target job
- Reorder bullets and projects to put the most relevant first
- Reframe bullets to use the job's language
- Drop low-relevance bullets and replace with more relevant ones from other sections
- Reorder the skills section to put job-relevant skills first
- Change tone and wording extensively

## WHAT IS FABRICATION (FAIL for these):
1. Adding tools, languages, or frameworks to TECHNICAL SKILLS that aren't in the original. The allowed skills are ONLY: {skills_str}
2. Inventing NEW metrics or numbers not in the original. The real metrics are: {metrics_str}
3. Inventing work that has no basis in any original bullet (completely new achievements).
4. Adding companies, roles, or degrees that don't exist.
5. Changing real numbers (inflating 80% to 95%, 500 nodes to 1000 nodes).

## WHAT IS NOT FABRICATION (do NOT fail for these):
- Rewording any bullet, even heavily, as long as the underlying work is real
- Combining two original bullets into one
- Splitting one original bullet into two
- Describing the same work with different emphasis
- Dropping bullets entirely
- Reordering anything
- Changing the title or summary completely

## TOLERANCE RULE:
The goal is to get interviews, not to be a perfect fact-checker. Allow up to 3 minor stretches per resume:
- Adding a closely related tool the candidate could realistically know is a MINOR STRETCH, not fabrication.
- Reframing a metric with slightly different wording is a MINOR STRETCH.
- Adding any LEARNABLE skill given their existing stack is a MINOR STRETCH.
- Only FAIL if there are MAJOR lies: completely invented projects, fake companies, fake degrees, wildly inflated numbers, or skills from a completely different domain.

Be strict about major lies. Be lenient about minor stretches and learnable skills. Do not fail for style, tone, or restructuring."""
